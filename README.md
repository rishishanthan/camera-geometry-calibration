# Geometry
**CSE 473/573 3D Geometry Project.**

The following commands should be executed in the root folder of the project. We will run these commands in autograder to grade you submission.
**Run task 1**

```bash
python task1.py --alpha 45 --beta 30 --gamma 50
```

**Run task 2**

```bash
python task2.py
```

**Pack your submission**
Note that when packing your submission, the script would run your code before packing. If pack_submission.sh is not working for you, please run the commands in pack_submission.sh manually, which will create the zip submission file.
```bash
sh pack_submission.sh <YourUBITName>
```
Change **<YourUBITName>** with your UBIT name.
The resulting zip file should be named **"submission\_<YourUBITName>.zip"**, and it should contain 3 files, named **"result_task1.json"**, **"result_task2.json,"**, and **"UB\_Geometry.py"**. If not, there is something wrong with your code/filename, please go back and check.

You should only submit the zip file.
